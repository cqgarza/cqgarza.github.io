I hold a Bachelor’s degree in International Business with a specialization in Business Intelligence, graduated from Tecnológico de Monterrey in Monterrey, Nuevo León, Mexico. During my undergraduate studies, I had the opportunity to travel to South America, Eurafrica, and Canada, where I gained new knowledge and cultural exposure.

After completing my professional education, I pursued a Master’s degree in Supply Chain and Logistics in France, specifically in the Auvergne region at Clermont-Ferrand, which I attended from 2020 to 2022. Later, I earned a second Master’s degree in Data Science from South Dakota State University in South Dakota, USA. These academic experiences allowed me to strengthen my technical expertise and develop new professional skills.

Throughout my career, I have immersed myself in multicultural and challenging environments, fostering resilience, independence, and autonomy. These experiences have refined my ability to communicate in multiple languages across diverse contexts and make effective decisions in complex situations. Such challenges have significantly contributed to both my personal and professional growth.
