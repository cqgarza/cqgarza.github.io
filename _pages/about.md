I hold a Bachelor's degree in International Business with a specialization in Business Intelligence. I graduated from Tecnológico de Monterrey, located in Monterrey, Nuevo León, Mexico. During my undergraduate studies, I had the opportunity to travel to South America, Eurafrica, and Canada, where I gained new knowledge and valuable cultural exposure.

Upon completing my undergraduate education, I pursued a master’s degree in France, in the city of Clermont-Ferrand, at the Clermont Graduate School of Management, specializing in supply chain and logistics. I studied there from 2020 to 2022. Subsequently, I continued my academic training in the United States, earning a master’s degree in Data Science at South Dakota State University. During these academic periods, I expanded my technical knowledge and developed new specialized skills, particularly in the areas of machine learning, databases, and advanced statistical systems.

I have decided to broadly share my knowledge, research, and scientific contributions, which are available through this platform and accessible to the general public.
